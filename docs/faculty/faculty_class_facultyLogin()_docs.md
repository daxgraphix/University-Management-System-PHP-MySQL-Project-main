3. The method checks the number of rows returned by the query. If it is equal to 1, it indicates a successful login.
4. If the login is successful, the method starts a session and sets session variables for the faculty member's ID, username, and name.
5. Finally, the method returns `true` if the login is successful, and `false` otherwise.
