## Summary
The code snippet is a method called `facultyRegistration` within the `DatabaseConnection` class. It registers a new faculty member by inserting their information into the `faculty` table in the database. It first checks if the username already exists in the table, and if not, it proceeds with the registration.

## Example Usage
```php
$database = new DatabaseConnection($config);
$database->facultyRegistration("John Doe", "johndoe", "password", "johndoe@example.com", "1990-01-01", "Male", "PhD", "1234567890", "123 Main St");
```

2. It executes the query and retrieves the number of rows returned.
3. If the count is 0, indicating that the username is not taken, it prepares an insert query to add the faculty member's information to the `faculty` table.
4. It binds the input parameters to the prepared statement.
5. It executes the insert query and returns true if the registration is successful.
