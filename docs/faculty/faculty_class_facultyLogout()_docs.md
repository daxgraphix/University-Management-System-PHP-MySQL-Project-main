## Code Analysis
### Inputs
No inputs are required for this code snippet.
___
### Flow
1. The code checks if the faculty member is logged in by checking the value of the `$_SESSION['fct_login']` variable.
2. If the faculty member is logged in, the code sets the value of `$_SESSION['fct_login']` to `false` to mark the faculty as logged out.
3. The code then unsets the specific faculty-related session variables (`$_SESSION['f_id']`, `$_SESSION['f_uname']`, `$_SESSION['f_name']`, `$_SESSION['fct_login']`).
4. If the faculty member is not logged in, the code does nothing.
5. Optionally, the code can destroy the entire session by calling `session_destroy()`.
