## Example Usage

$databaseConnection = new DatabaseConnection($config);
$studentId = 1;

## Code Analysis
### Inputs
- `$student_id` (integer): The ID of the student to retrieve information for.
___
### Flow
1. The method prepares an SQL query to retrieve all information of a specific student from the `st_info` table based on the provided student ID.
2. It gets the database connection using the `getConnection` method from the parent class.
3. The student ID parameter is bound to the prepared query using the `bindParam` method.
4. The query is executed using the `execute` method on the prepared statement.
5. If the query execution is successful, the method returns the PDOStatement object representing the result set.
6. If an exception occurs during the execution of the query, the error is logged.
7. If the query fails or an error occurs, the method returns null.
___
### Outputs
- `PDOStatement|null`: The PDOStatement object representing the result set if the query execution is successful, or null if the query fails or an error occurs.
