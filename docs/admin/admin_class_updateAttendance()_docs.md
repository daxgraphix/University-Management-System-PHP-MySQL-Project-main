## Code Analysis
### Inputs
- `$date` (string): The date for which attendance records are being updated.
- `$atten` (array): An associative array with student `st_id` as keys and updated attendance values (`present` or `absent`) as values.
___
### Flow
1. Get the database connection using the `getConnection` method from the parent class.
2. Iterate over each student in the `$atten` array.
3. Prepare an SQL query to update the attendance record for the current student on the given date.
4. Bind the attendance value, student ID, and date to the prepared statement.
5. Execute the query and store the result.
6. If the update fails for any student, return `false`.
7. If all updates are successful, return `true`.
8. If any exception occurs during the process, log the error and return `false`.
___
### Outputs
