## Summary
This code snippet is a method called `updateResult` within a class. It updates the results of a student for specific subjects and a given semester in a database table. It takes the student ID, an associative array of subjects and their corresponding marks, and the semester as inputs. The method executes an SQL query to update the `marks` column in the `result` table based on the provided parameters. It uses a prepared statement to prevent SQL injection and loops through each subject to update the result. If any update fails, it returns false. If all updates are successful, it returns true.

## Example Usage
```php
$studentId = 1;
$subjects = [
    'Math' => 90,
    'Science' => 85,
    'English' => 95
];
$semester = 2;

$result = $databaseConnection->updateResult($studentId, $subjects, $semester);
if ($result) {
    echo "Results updated successfully.";
} else {
    echo "Failed to update results.";
}
```

## Code Analysis
### Inputs
- `$studentId` (integer): The ID of the student.
- `$subjects` (array): An associative array of subjects and their corresponding marks.
- `$semester` (integer): The semester for which to update the results.
___
### Flow
1. The method receives the student ID, subjects, and semester as inputs.
2. It prepares an SQL query to update the `marks` column in the `result` table for the specified student, subjects, and semester.
3. It establishes a database connection using the `getConnection` method from the parent class.
4. It loops through each subject in the `$subjects` array.
5. Inside the loop, it binds the parameters to the prepared statement, including the student ID, semester, subject, and mark.
6. It executes the update statement and stores the result in the `$result` variable.
7. If any update fails, it returns false.
8. If all updates are successful, it returns true.
___
### Outputs
- `true` if all updates are successful.
- `false` if any update fails.
