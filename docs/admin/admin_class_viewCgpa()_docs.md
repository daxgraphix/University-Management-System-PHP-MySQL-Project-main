## Summary
The code snippet is a method called `viewCgpa` within a class. It retrieves the CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average) for a specific student from a database table. The method uses a try-catch block to handle any potential database errors and returns the query result if data is found, or false if an error occurs or no data is found.

## Example Usage
```php
$databaseConnection = new DatabaseConnection($config);
$result = $databaseConnection->viewCgpa($studentId);
if ($result) {
    // Process the result
} else {
    // Handle the error or no data found
}
```

## Code Analysis
### Inputs
- `$studentId` (integer): The ID of the student for whom the CGPA is to be retrieved.
___
### Flow
1. The SQL query is prepared with a parameterized statement to select all rows from the `result` table where the `st_id` column matches the provided `$studentId`.
2. A database connection is established by calling the `getConnection` method from the parent class.
3. The SQL statement is prepared using the connection and the query.
4. The student ID parameter is bound to the prepared statement.
5. The statement is executed.
6. The result is fetched as an associative array using the `fetchAll` method.
7. If the result contains any data (i.e., the count of rows is greater than 0), it is returned.
8. If an exception occurs during the execution of the statement or no data is found, the exception is caught and a database error message is logged.
9. Finally, false is returned to indicate an error or no data found.
___
### Outputs
- The query result as an associative array if data is found.
- False if an error occurs or no data is found.
