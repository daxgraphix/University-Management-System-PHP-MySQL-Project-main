## Summary
This code snippet is a method called `fetchAllStudents()` that belongs to the `DatabaseConnection` class. It retrieves information for all students from the 'st_info' table in the database and returns the result as a PDOStatement object representing the result set.

## Example Usage
```php
$dbConnection = new DatabaseConnection($config);
$result = $dbConnection->fetchAllStudents();
if ($result) {
    while ($row = $result->fetch()) {
        // Process each student record
    }
} else {
    // Handle the case when there are no student records or an error occurred
}
```

## Code Analysis
### Inputs
There are no inputs for this code snippet.
___
### Flow
1. The SQL query is defined to select all student information from the 'st_info' table and order the results by the 'st_id' column in ascending order.
2. The method calls the `getConnection()` method of the parent class to establish a database connection.
3. The SQL statement is prepared using the database connection.
4. The prepared statement is executed.
5. If the statement execution is successful, the method returns the PDOStatement object representing the result set.
6. If an exception occurs during the execution or any other database error occurs, the exception is caught and an error message is logged.
7. If there is an error or exception, the method returns null instead of false.
___
### Outputs
The method returns a PDOStatement object representing the result set of all student records from the 'st_info' table. If there are no student records or an error occurs, the method returns null.
