## Summary
The code snippet is a method called `searchStudents` within the `DatabaseConnection` class. It performs a search for students in the database based on a provided search parameter. The method executes a SQL query to select all records from the `st_info` table where the `st_id`, `name`, `contact`, or `email` columns match the search parameter. The matching results are returned as an array of associative arrays.

## Example Usage
```php
$database = new DatabaseConnection($config);
$searchParam = "John";
$results = $database->searchStudents($searchParam);
print_r($results);
```

## Code Analysis
### Inputs
- `$searchParam` (string): The search parameter to match against the `st_id`, `name`, `contact`, and `email` columns in the database.
___
### Flow
1. The method receives a search parameter as input.
2. It constructs a SQL query to select records from the `st_info` table where the search parameter matches the `st_id`, `name`, `contact`, or `email` columns.
3. The method establishes a database connection by calling the `getConnection` method from the parent class.
4. It prepares the SQL statement using the database connection.
5. The search parameter is bound to the `:parameter` placeholder in the SQL statement.
6. The query is executed using the `execute` method on the prepared statement.
7. The method fetches all matching results as associative arrays using the `fetchAll` method.
8. The matching results are returned as an array of associative arrays.
___
### Outputs
- An array of matching student records as associative arrays, or `false` if there was an error executing the query.
