## Code Analysis
### Inputs
- `$date` (string): The date for which attendance records are requested.
___
### Flow
1. The method establishes a database connection by calling the `getConnection` method from the parent class.
2. It prepares an SQL query to select attendance records for all students on a specific date.
3. The query uses an inner join to combine the `at_student` and `attn` tables based on the `st_id` column.
4. The `at_date` column is filtered by the provided date using a parameterized query.
5. The prepared statement is executed and if successful, the attendance records are fetched as an array of associative arrays.
6. The method returns the fetched attendance records.
7. If any exception occurs during the process, the method catches the `PDOException`, logs the error message, and returns false.
___
### Outputs
- An array of attendance records for all students if the query is executed successfully.
- False if any exception occurs during the process.
