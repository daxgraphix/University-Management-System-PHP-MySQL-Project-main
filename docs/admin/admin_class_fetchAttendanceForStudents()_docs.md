## Summary
This code snippet is a method called `fetchAttendanceForStudents()` that retrieves attendance information for students from a database table. It executes a SQL query to select all attendance information from the `at_student` table. It establishes a database connection, prepares the SQL statement, and executes it. If the statement is executed successfully, it fetches and returns the results as an array of associative arrays. If there is any database error, it logs the error message. If there is a failure in executing the query, it returns false.

## Example Usage
```php
$databaseConnection = new DatabaseConnection($config);
$attendanceRecords = $databaseConnection->fetchAttendanceForStudents();
if ($attendanceRecords) {
    foreach ($attendanceRecords as $record) {
        // Process attendance record
    }
} else {
    // Handle failure
}
```
