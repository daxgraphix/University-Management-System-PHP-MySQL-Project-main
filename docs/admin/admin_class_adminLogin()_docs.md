## Summary
This code snippet is a method called `adminLogin` that attempts to log in an admin user by checking the provided username and password against the 'admin' table in the database. If the credentials match, the method sets session variables for the successful login and returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

## Example Usage
```php
$database = new DatabaseConnection($config);
$loggedIn = $database->adminLogin($username, $password);
if ($loggedIn) {
    echo "Admin login successful";
} else {
    echo "Admin login failed";
}
```

## Code Analysis
### Inputs
- `$username` (string): The admin username.
- `$password` (string): The admin password.
___
### Flow
1. The method receives the admin username and password as input.
2. It constructs an SQL query to check the admin credentials against the 'admin' table.
3. It establishes a database connection using the `getConnection` method inherited from the parent class.
4. It prepares the SQL statement using the query.
5. It binds the username and password parameters to the prepared statement.
6. It executes the query and retrieves the result.
7. If the query is successful and returns one row, it fetches the result as an associative array.
8. It checks the row count to ensure that only one row is returned.
9. If the row count is 1, it sets session variables for the successful login and returns true.
10. If any error occurs during the database operations, it catches the `PDOException` and logs the error.
11. If the login fails or any error occurs, it returns false.
___
### Outputs
- `true` if the login is successful.
- `false` if the login fails.
